      <p>
        Hi! I'm Tony. I am from Long Island, New York. After college I was
        unsure of the path I wanted to take for my career. In 2016 I met the CTO
        of a startup company playing DoTA 2 (a MOBA videogame!) and shortly
        after was offered a job in their Quality Assurance department. After a
        few years of working as a QA engineer I became the techical writer for
        the company. While I enjoyed my work I knew I was up for something more
        challenging, and I decided to explore software engineering as a
        potential career path!
